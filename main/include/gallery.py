Artefact1 = " Strange that I did not know him then, \n \
That friend of mine! \n \
I did not even show him then \n \
One friendly sign; \n \n \
\
But cursed him for the ways he had \n \
To make me see \n \
My envy of the praise he had \n \
For praising me. \n \n \
\
I would have rid the earth of him \n \
Once, in my pride!... \n \
I never knew the worth of him \n \
Until he died. \n"

Artefact2 = " Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, \n \
And sorry I could not travel both \n \
And be one traveler, long I stood \n \
And looked down one as far as I could \n \
To where it bent in the undergrowth. \n \n \
\
Then took the other, as just as fair, \n \
And having perhaps the better claim, \n \
Because it was grassy and wanted wear; \n \
Though as for that the passing there \n \
Had worn them really about the same. \n \n \
\
And both that morning equally lay \n \
In leaves no step had trodden black. \n \
Oh, I kept the first for another day! \n \
Yet knowing how way leads on to way, \n \
I doubted if I should ever come back. \n \n \
\
I shall be telling this with a sigh \n \
Somewhere ages and ages hence: \n \
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-- \n \
I took the one less traveled by, \n \
And that has made all the difference. \n"

Artefact3 = " Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day? \n \
Thou art more lovely and more temperate: \n \
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, \n \
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date: \n \n \
\
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, \n \
And often is his gold complexion dimm’d, \n \
And every fair from fair sometime declines, \n \
By chance or natures changing course untrimm’d: \n \n \
\
But thy eternal summer shall not fade, \n \
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest, \n \
Nor shall death brag thou wandrest in his shade, \n \
When in eternal lines to time thou growest, \n \n \
\
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see \n \
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee. \n"

Artefact4 = " I won’t beg for your love: it’s laid \n \
Safely to rest, let the earth settle... \n \
Don’t expect my jealous letters \n \
Pouring in to plague your bride. \n \n \
\
But let me, nevertheless, advise you: \n \
Give her my poems to read in bed, \n \
Give her my portraits to keep — it’s wise to\n \
Be kind like that when newly-wed. \n"

Artefact5 = " She walks in beauty, like the night \n \
Of cloudless climes and starry skies; \n \
And all that's best of dark and bright \n \
Meet in her aspect and her eyes: \n \n \
\
Thus mellow'd to that tender light \n \
Which heaven to gaudy day denies. \n \
One shade the more, one ray the less, \n \
Had half impair'd the nameless grace \n \n \
\
Which waves in every raven tress, \n \
Or softly lightens o'er her face; \n \
Where thoughts serenely sweet express \n \
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place. \n \n \
\
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow, \n \
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent, \n \
The smiles that win. the tints that glow, \n \
But tell of days in goodness spent, \n \n \
\
A mind at peace with all below, \n \
A heart whose love is innocent! \n"

Artefact6 = " There is a smile of love, \n \
And there is a smile of deceit, \n \
And there is a smile of smiles \n \
In which these two smiles meet. \n \n \
\
And there is a frown of hate, \n \
And there is a frown of disdain, \n \
And there is a frown of frowns \n \
Which you strive to forget in vain, \n \n \
\
For it sticks in the heart's deep core \n \
And it sticks in the deep backbone \n \
And no smile that ever was smile, \n \
But only one smile alone, \n \n \
\
That betwixt the cradle and grave \n \
It only once smile can be; \n \
And, when it once is smile, \n \
There's an end to all misery. \n"

Artefact7 = " If you can keep your head when all about you \n \
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, \n \
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, \n \
But make allowance for their doubting too; \n \n \
\
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, \n \
Or being lied about, don't deal in lies, \n \
Or being hated don't give way to hating, \n \
And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise: \n \n \
\
If you can dream-and not make dreams your master; \n \
If you can think-and not make thoughts your aim, \n \
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster \n \
And treat those two impostors just the same; \n \n \
\
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken \n \
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, \n \
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, \n \
And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools: \n \n \
\
If you can make one heap of all your winnings \n \
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, \n \
And lose, and start again at your beginnings \n \
And never breathe a word about your loss; \n \n \
\
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew \n \
To serve your turn long after they are gone, \n \
And so hold on when there is nothing in you \n \
Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!' \n \n \
\
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, \n \
Or walk with Kings-nor lose the common touch, \n \
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, \n \
If all men count with you, but none too much; \n \n \
\
If you can fill the unforgiving minute \n \
With sixty seconds' worth of distance run, \n \
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, \n \
And-which is more-you'll be a Man, my son! \n"

Artefact8 = " What do I owe to you \n \
Who loved me deep and long? \n \
You never gave my spirit wings \n \
Or gave my heart a song. \n \n \
\
But oh, to him I loved, \n \
Who loved me not at all, \n \
I owe the open gate \n \
That led through heaven's wall. \n"

Artefact9 = " I saw him once before, \n \
As he passed by the door, \n \
And again \n \
The pavement stones resound, \n \
As he totters o'er the ground \n \
With his cane. \n \n \
\
They say that in his prime,\n \
Ere the pruning-knife of Time \n \
Cut him down, \n \
Not a better man was found \n \
By the crier on his round \n \
Through the town. \n \n \
\
But now he walks the streets, \n \
And he looks at all he meets \n \
Sad and wan, \n \
And he shakes his feeble head, \n \
That it seems as if he said, \n \
’They are gone.’ \n \n \
\
The mossy marbles rest \n \
On the lips that he has pressed \n \
In their bloom, \n \
And the names he loved to hear \n \
Have been carved for many a year \n \
On the tomb. \n \n \
\
My grandmamma has said - \n \
Poor old lady, she is dead \n \
Long ago - \n \
That he had a Roman nose, \n \
And his cheek was like a rose \n \
In the snow. \n \n \
\
But now his nose is thin, \n \
And it rests upon his chin \n \
Like a staff, \n \
And a crook is in his back, \n \
And a melancholy crack \n \
In his laugh. \n \n \
\
I know it is a sin \n \
For me to sit and grin \n \
At him here; \n \
But the old three-cornered hat, \n \
And the breeches, and all that, \n \
Are so queer! \n \n \
\
And if I should live to be \n \
The last leaf upon the tree \n \
In the spring, \n \
Let them smile, as I do now, \n \
At the old, forsaken bough \n \
Where I cling. \n"

Artefact10 = " Cruelty has a human heart, \n \
And Jealousy a human face; \n \
Terror the human form divine, \n \
And secrecy the human dress. \n \n \
\
The human dress is forged iron, \n \
The human form a fiery forge, \n \
The human face a furnace seal’d, \n \
The human heart its hungry gorge. \n"
